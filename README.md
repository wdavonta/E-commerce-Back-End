Then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.The server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.When you open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.When you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, you be able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
